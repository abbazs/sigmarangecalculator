# What are the hypothysis?
## Already discovered hypothysis
1. If **NIFTY** touches either side of the sigmas it doesn't touch the oppsite side sigma.
2. If in the previous month **NIFTY** has touched lower 3 sigmam there is a high probability that it will touch upper 2 sigma in the next month.
3. When the volatility is very low lets say the IVR is very low, then expect **NIFTY** to go down significantly. _**Need to bring in clarity.**_
4. When volatility is very high - IV rank is very high, then expect **NIFTY** to go up significantly. _**Need to bring in clarity.**_ Backtesting already supports this.

## To be discovered
1. What is the significance of MAX Open Interest (**OI**):
    1. After what count of OI that **spot** doesn't cross the MAX OI strike? Is it 40L or 50L or what it is?
    2. What is the safe/unsafe distance of MAX OI from the spot at the begenning of the expiry?
        1. Distance is measured as number of strikes MAX OI is away from the spot.
        2. What is the MAX OI distance that **NIFTY** has never crossed in the past?
        3. What is the MAX OI distance that **NIFTY** has always crossed?
    3. Is there a significane to the distance between MAX OI PE and MAX OI CE?
